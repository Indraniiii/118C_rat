## Analyzing differing frequencies bandsâ€™ contributions to wake v. sleep states in rats

In our exploration of a rat LFP in both the wakefulness and sleeping state, the question that came up was the differences in the spectral properties between the two states. Specifically, what, if any, particular bands (ranging from low to high frequency bands) contributed to the two states; if certain bands were consistent or differing from each other. In line with papers by Konno et. al (2021), and the original paper of Watson et al., Neuron (2016), our group looked into the differing frequency bands (i.e., from low frequency bands like delta; to middle-ranged bands gamma and beta) to see if this was consistent. In order to carry this out, the appropriate signaling processing technique we propose to use is via Fourier analysis and the power spectrum density (PSD) of the LFP to see what bands may contribute to the individual states of wakefulness and sleep. 
In addition to finding differing bands, we are expecting the existence of sleep spindles (waves around 11-16 Hz) and K-complexes (smaller delta waves, 0.5-4Hz) to be consistently found in sleep states.
